# What is this? #

The covid19.py script aggregates the vaccination data from data.gov.lv and shows the amount of vaccinated people by each vaccination stage and vaccine type. The goal is to obtain a vacciantion percentage for each group.

# TODOs #
* Substract expired vaccinations from the summed count by type
* Get the count of the people eligible for vacction to obtain a ratio
